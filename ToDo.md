# To Do

1. Build Transcriptomes using TransPi

- [x] Assemble de novo transcriptomes using TransPi
- [] Read the manuscript and understand what the point is of combining all assemblies
- [] Understand how evigenes are different to the "genes" (versus transcripts) produced by Trinity


2. Find Repeats

- [] Use RepeatMasker and RepeatModeler to find repeats in the assemblies

3. Find expression of specific genes related to repetitive elements
