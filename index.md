# TFM - Abundance, but not regulation of Transposable Elements differs in frogs with hugely different genome sizes and developmental plasticity
### Paula Sianes Castillo

This is the front page of my git website dedicated to my TFM. My project consisted in measuring the abundance of transposable elements (TEs) in the genome of two closely related toad species, as well as the activity of TEs silencing genes.\

Here I present an schematic image of my analysis.\
