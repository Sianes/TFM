# TFM - Abundance, but not regulation of Transposable Elements differs in frogs with hugely different genome sizes and developmental plasticity
### Paula Sianes Castillo

This is the front page of my git website dedicated to my TFM. My project consisted in measuring the abundance of transposable elements (TEs) in the genome of two closely related toad species, as well as the activity of TEs silencing genes.

Below are links to the different workflows for my TFM:


* [Study System](Study_system.md)
* [Running the TransPi pipeline](transpi.md)
* [Finding repeats](repeats.md)
* [Functional annotations](functional_annotation.md)
* [Differential gene expression](DEG_24h.r)
* [Extract the annotation of transcripts of interest and join with their abundance](join_annotation_counts_piwis_agos.r)
